# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that enables several extra features, including server-side rendering and generating static websites. It's a production-ready framework that allows you to create full-stack web applications by extending the latest React features.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides a great developer experience with all the features you need for production:

- **Hybrid Static & Server Rendering**: Optimize for search engines and improve performance with static generation (SSG), or use server-side rendering (SSR) for dynamic content.
- **Fast Refresh**: Instantly see changes as you edit your code without losing component state.
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Use CSS Modules, Sass, and other styling options out of the box.
- **API Routes**: Create API endpoints easily as Node.js serverless functions.

## Setting Up Your First Next.js Project

Getting started with Next.js is straightforward. You can create a new project using `create-next-app`:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
